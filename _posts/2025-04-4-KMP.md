# String Matching

String matching is used for finding *patterns* inside of larger *texts*. 

An example of this could be the the pattern {% katex %} P=\text{ababaca} {% endkatex %}.

The key to understanding the runtime of the KMP algorithm is understanding the *prefix function*, {% katex %} \pi {% endkatex %}.
